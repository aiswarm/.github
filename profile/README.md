# Welcome to the AI Swarm GitHub Organization

If you want to try out the AI Swarm, check out the [Conductor](https://github.com/aiswarm/conductor) project. It bundles all necessary components to provide easy access to the web UI and the CLI.

For documentation, examples, and other resources to help you get started with AI Swarm, check out the [AI Swarm Community Repository](https://github.com/aiswarm/aiswarm).

If you'd like to build your own plugin for the AI Swarm, look at the different plugins we're already using as a starting point below. The names should be self-explanatory.
